# Restaurant Management System

Nowadays, we live in a digitalized world, where technology is part of every aspect of our lives. Data is saved and processed online, which leads to more efficiency, security and less time consumption. Therefore, restaurants can no longer continue to operate using traditional primitive methods like waiters keeping orders in handwritten notebooks or computing financial reports with Microsoft Excel.

The software we are providing aims to keep track of the day-to-day activity of a restaurant and facilitate the work of the staff by reducing manual work and effectively coordinating between the different sectors. The system will also make the management of the restaurant much easier as it will maintain records not only on orders and supplies but also on the daily performance of each employee and the hours they have worked. Lastly, our application will help introduce the restaurant to the possible clients who will be able to reserve a table or communicate with the staff without wasting any time.

The purpose of this software is to build a system which will help the restaurant in their daily work, using all the techniques that we know, ensuring effectiveness and efficiency to save time for both the customer and the restaurant staff. Some of the main actions the software will provide are very organized and detailed information regarding generating reports, employee records and managing orders.
