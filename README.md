# Restaurant Management System

It is a well known fact that the restaurants have been the most affected throughout the coronavirus pandemic. They were forced to shut down temporarily for a long period of time. In order to avoid bankruptcy, many restaurants have introduced delivery services. Not only take-away is a great way for the restaurant to maintain its business, but also it is a convenient option for the customers. Digital take-away satisfies the demand for ready-to-eat delivery and customers can order their favorite customized meals or even make their reservations online faster,easier and in just couple of clicks away.

The Restaurant Management System is used to keep track of day to day activity of the restaurant. Its development aims to provide service facility to the restaurant as well as to the customer. It will be designed by 2 approaches. The first one will be the client-side which will consist a simple web page with several services, while the other one will include employees handling their clients, their orders and helping them easily find free tables or place orders.
